Problem Statement

Managing a small library manually can be time-consuming and can lead to errors. 
Tasks such as record book details, track issued books, search for specific titles, and manage returns or deletions often lead to inconsistencies when done on paper.
The absence of a simple automated system makes it difficult for library staff or students to quickly access book information or monitor availability. 
This project aims to solve these issues by providing a basic console-based Library Management System that helps organize books efficiently and perform essential library operations in an accurate and user-friendly way.

Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes creating a functional system capable of handling fundamental library operations such as adding books, listing all books, searching for books, issuing books to students, returning issued books, and deleting books when needed. 
The project focuses on core functionalities rather than advanced features such as user authentication, digital record storage, or graphical interfaces. 
It is designed to run in a simple terminal environment and maintain data only during runtime using Python’s built-in data structures. 
The system’s scope is intentionally kept minimal to serve educational purposes and demonstrate how basic library workflows can be automated.

Target Users

This project is intended for small library administrators, school lab instructors, students learning programming, and beginners who want to understand how management systems are developed. 
It is also suitable for teachers demonstrating logic building, data handling, and modular programming in Python. 
Because it operates through a simple menu-driven interface, it can be used by anyone who needs a lightweight, temporary system for handling a small collection of books.

High-Level Features

A menu-driven interface that allows users to perform library operations easily.

Functionality to add new books with essential information like ID, title, author, and quantity.

Ability to view all books currently stored in the system.

Search functionality to quickly locate a book using its unique ID.

Issue-book feature that reduces quantity and tracks which student borrowed the book.

Return-book feature that restores quantity and removes the issued record.

Option to delete books from the system when they are no longer needed.

Simple, intuitive text-based interaction without external dependencies.
